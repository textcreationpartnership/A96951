            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Narration.</head>
               <p>IN my younger years being bred up in the Univerſity, and having taken a Degree there, I was admitted into one of the Inns of Court: Where having ſpent about two years (Means now failing for my ſupport and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in that courſe) I was received into the Family of an Honourable Perſonage; mine Employments being in the way of a Scholar; as to write Letters, to read Divinity, to pen Sermons, to pray with the Family, in the Chaplains abſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe the heart of the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Governour toward me, that great ſecular prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were endeavoured for me: But, none of them ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, I was at length by Mandate from his then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty (procured by the means of that Noble Perſonage) replanted into my old Nurſery, a Fellow of a Colledge there.</p>
               <p>I yearly payd mine acknowledgment by attendance, where I had received ſo much Favour: the good will, and endeavour; of worldly preferments for me, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing.</p>
               <p>One at laſt was freely offered unto me; of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as I moſt deſired, with viſible (almoſt) certainties of great wealth, and temporal advancement, had it been accepted; but Providence had otherwiſe diſpoſed of me.</p>
               <p>For, when, upon the offer, my anſwer of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was expected, I was ſurprized with a ſudden amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſtanding ſilent like a Statue, had not one word to ſpeak, by way of acknowledgment of mine own
<pb facs="tcp:137309:4"/> unworthineſs, or of the greatneſs of the intended Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; much leſs to expreſs my ready acceptance thereof, and due thankfulneſs for it; and ſo for ſome time conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, was diſmiſſed for the preſent, and within ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after became a ſtranger to thoſe Relations.</p>
               <p>Having after this (as I eſteemed it) unhappy rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſpent ſome years in the Colledge (vainly and idly enough, God knows) it was the Lords pleaſure to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant me into his Church abroad.

               <p>I had now continued at my Living five or ſix years, or more; when (I do not remember, that the day before,
<pb facs="tcp:137309:4"/> or at any time for ſome years then paſt, I had had ſuch thoughts, as might miniſter matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to my Fancy ſo to work.) The Lord was pleaſed, in a Dream and Viſion of the night [thus] to ſeal Inſtruction unto my ſoul, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 15, 16.</p>

               <p>AT <hi>London,</hi> I was apprehended by a ſhag hair'd Fellow, without an hat, of a deformed countenance.</p>
               <p>He led me on, I knew not whither, until we came unto a Priſon, ſcituated where <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall ſtands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At the entrance into the Hall.</p>
               <p>The Front of the Priſon was toward the <hi>Thames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gate was wide, and ſtood wide open.</p>
               <p>The chief Priſon-houſe was in view, a croſs-building within at the end of a Court-yard.</p>
               <p>There was a window on the right hand of the Gate-houſe, which had a ſtrong Iron grate before it (as had the windows on the ſide-buildings, on the left hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the chief Priſon houſe) through which I could diſcern mens faces.</p>
               <p>At the entrance of the chief Priſon-houſe ſtood the Jaylor a grim man in black.</p>
               <p>He, ſeeing of us, preſently comes to us to the gate; and turning my Apprehender a little aſide to whiſper with him;</p>
               <p>As they were whiſpering, my Apprehender let go his hold.</p>
               <p>I perceiving his hand off, thought it beſt to run for my ſafety; and betook me to my heels.</p>
               <p>My Apprehender purſues me.</p>
               <p>But having the ſtart of him, I was gotten ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>I could ſee a good way off a Gentleman, who had ſtopped him in his purſuit; and by the hair of his head, having pulled him down upon his knees, was beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him with a Battoon.</p>
               <p>I ſtill fearing that he might get looſe, and follow me, ran on until I came at the <hi>Savoy;</hi> where,</p>

               <p>Whereupon, attempting to get down between two of the Jyces, there were men below within the Building, who endeavoured, by thruſting at me with an Halberd, and long ſtaves, to hinder my Deſcent.</p>
               <p>But, the danger I fled from made me ſo reſolute, that, putting by their thruſts, I got down in ſpight of them.</p>
               <p>I was no ſooner below, but they were all vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>From hence I was immediatly transferred into the Tower of the Temple-Church; and ſtanding where the Eſſigies of the Knights-T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Round about on the ſides, the Tower was ſcaffolded up from the Pavement as in a Theater.</p>

               <p> I awaked, and muſing upon the Viſion in my mind, and finding that it had a kind of orderly dependance one part upon another; aſſoon as I aroſe, I wrote it down, and gave I know not what Interpretation of it.</p>
               <p>The writing (unminded) lay among my looſe Papers many years; until (which I believe was nine or ten years after) the Lord was pleaſed to lay upon me the heavy burden of a wounded Spirit.</p>
               <p>In mine extremity (which was ſo high, that I feared death) having over-looked my looſe Papers, and this Viſion (curſorily) among the reſt, I caſt them into the fire.</p>

               <p>I am far from idolizing of humane learning: but, that it is not by any to be trampled upon, that Doctor's (in theſe late Times) being (in a manner) ſtriken dumb, when about to ſtrangle it in the Nurſery, and to cry it down in his Pulpit, even in the Univerſity, gives a loud item to it's proudeſt Oppoſers: whoſe either,</p>

               <p>Our late fears (indeed) were great: the Cloud began to look black, and the ſtinking Fog to ſpread apace. But, (bleſſed be God) the Sun is riſen ſeaſonably: whoſe bright beams (we truſt) will ſoondiſpel them, and reſtore our <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> to it's former clearneſs.</p>

               <p>WHen I firſt entered into the Miniſtry, God knows I was a moſt unfit man for ſo high, and Holy an employment: and ſo continued until I came unto this Place.</p>
               <p>The Sermons, which I then preached before my Change, it is poſſible might be a means to open the Gate of Heaven to others, while I my ſelf ſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
               <p>Being ſetled here, my Lord Chriſt was pleaſed (as he dealt by his choſen Veſſel St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9 6, 15.) by a rough breaking to put my heart into a new frame, and (in part) to fit me for the great Work, to which he had called me.</p>
               <p>I had now attained to the top of the Hill of man's age, and was deſcending: The ſixth hour of my day was paſt; yet, then was I ſent into the Vineyard, <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No time while the day of life continues, can bar man from mercy, 10. 9. 4.</p>

               <p>The Miniſter was unknown to me. His Text was, about the unclean Spirit's returning to his Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and taking to him ſeven other Spirits more wicked than himſelf, <hi>&amp;c. Math.</hi> 12. 43, 44, 45.</p>
               <p>Although for ſome time I did not much mind him: yet at length, upon his well-handling of his Matter, I was perſwaded with an attentive ear to liſten unto him: and before the concluſion of his Sermon, ſomewhat was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by him, which the Spirit was pleaſed to carry home to my heart; and to make uſe of it as an Hammer, to break that Rock in pieces, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 29.</p>
               <p>I was there rouzed out of my ſecurity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and began to think, what a dangerous condition my Soul was in: and could not forbear ſaying to the ſervant of the Inn, who at night lighted me up to my Chamber; We, that teach others to be good, ſhould be good our ſelves: which he departing anſwered with a curſe.</p>
               <p>My terrours increaſed upon me, to the diſturbance of my Reaſon: and ſo I continued for ſome weeks, after my return home.</p>

And, the truth is, my thoughts, by converſing with them, were ſoon taken off, from where they ſhould have been fixed.</p>
               <p>The Lord called to mourning: and there followed indeed</p>

                  <hi>AT London,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was apprehended by a ſhag-hair'd Fellow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Hat, of a deformed Countenance.</p>
               <p>He led me on, I knew not whither, untill we came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Priſon, ſcituated where <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> ſtands: at the Entrance into the Hall,</p>
               <p>The Front of the Priſon was toward the <hi>Thames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gate was wide, and ſtood wide open.</p>
               <p>The chief Priſon-Houſe was in view, a Croſs-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within at the end of a Court-yard.</p>
               <p>There was a window on the right hand of the Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, which had a ſtrong Iron Grate before it, (as had the windows on the ſide-buildings on the left hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Chief Priſon-Houſe) through which I could diſcern mens faces.</p>
               <p>At the Entrance of the chief Priſon-Houſe, ſtood the Jaylor, a grim man in black.</p>
               <p>He, ſeeing of us, preſently comes to us to the Gate; and, turning my Apprehender a little aſide to whiſper with him,</p>
               <p>As they were whiſpering, my Apprehender let go his hold.</p>
               <p>I perceiving his hand off, thought it beſt to run for my ſafety; and betook me to my heels.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:137309:35"/>
               <p> My Apprehender purſues me: But having the ſtart of him, I was gotten ſo far before him, that I could not hear him following.</p>
               <p>Having now ran almoſt as far as the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to ſee at what diſtance I had lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> him;</p>
               <p>I could ſee a good way off, a Gentleman, who had ſtopped him in his purſuit; and by the hair of his head, having pull'd him down upon his knees, was beating of him with a Battoon.</p>
               <p>I, ſtill fearing that he might get looſe, and follow me, ran on, untill I came at the <hi>Savoy:</hi> Where,</p>
               <p>I ran down a pair of Stairs:</p>
               <p>Which ſtairs delivered me on to a ſquare Brick-Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, raiſed one Story from the ground, left ſo, that the work might be continued; having Beams and Jyces, laid ready for a Floor and ſecond Story.</p>
               <p>In this Building, I was perſwaded, I might hide my ſelf from my Purſuer.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, attempting to get down between two of the Jyces, there were men below within the Building, who endeavoured, by thruſting at me with an Halberd, and long ſtaves, to hinder my deſcent.</p>
               <p>But the danger I fled from, made me ſo reſolute, that, putting by their Thruſts, I gate down in ſpight of them.</p>
               <p>I was no ſooner below, but they were all vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>From hence, I was immediatly transferred into the Tower of the Temple Church: and ſtanding where the Effigies of the Knights-Templers lie, (then not to be ſeen) all fear, of being taken again by my Purſuer, was now ceaſed.</p>
               <p>I caſt mine eye up to the top of the Tower, where my ſight was limited by a cloudy reſemblance.</p>
               <p>Round about on the ſides, the Tower was ſcaffolded up from the Pavement, as in a Theater.</p>

                  <p>THat God alone is able to change the Heart, is Clear.</p>

                  <p> There is nothing in the Soul, out of which it may be produced, as therein potentially contained.

                  <p>But, may not man deſerve this Change? May he not walk ſo exactly by Natures Rule, as, that God, in equity, cannot deny his Grace unto him?</p>
                  <p>No: This Grace is free, this Love undeſerved, What is in the ſick Patient to deſerve, that the Phyſitian ſhould ſeek him out, to cure him? What in an Enemy to deſerve Reconciliation from him, to whom he hath given juſt cauſe to hate him?</p>
                  <p>Yet, when I was ſick, and languiſhing, my Phyſitian ſought me, to recover me: My highly provoked God, when I was his Enemy, was pleaſed freely to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto me, <hi>Col</hi> 1. 19, 10.</p>

                  <p>Yet, then was the Lord pleaſed (not for my ſake, but for his own Holy Names ſake) to pity me, to put a new Spirit in me, to ſave me (from all mine Enemies) from all mine uncleanneſſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31, 21, 26, 31.</p>

                  <p>Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe I was put in mind of, by my running down the ſtairs.</p>
                  <p>By ſtairs, we deſcend downwards: In Humiliation for ſin, the ſoul is brought down, even to a putting of the mouth in the duſt, <hi>Lam</hi> 3. 29.

All I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, and every high thing, which formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, is caſt down; and every thought brought into captivity to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt, who is now, upon effectual Calling, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the ſoul, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is received into the ſoul by Faith, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. Of this Faith, Repentance (wrought in the heart at the ſame time, by the ſame means, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25.) is an inſeparable Companion: The Will, which in Faith is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:137309:70"/> turned to the enjoyment of the true Good, being in repentance turned to the doing of what is truly good; with an hatred of, and turning from, the contrary evil.</p>
                  <p>There is a repentance, which may be in the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, ariſing from the Terrour of the Law, having Gods Wrath alone for its Object. This is but a compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or pricking at the heart, accompanied with fear of puniſhment, ſuch as was in <hi>Peters</hi> Auditors, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. However, this (as it did in them) may diſpoſe and prepare the heart for Faith.</p>

                  <p> Servile, or ſlaviſh fear, proceeding from the ſpirit of Bondage, is good and commendable, as it awes from ſin, and approved of by God in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 5. 29. This, as preparing the ſoul for the great work, is firſt wrought in every one, that is effectually called at ripeneſs of years, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. It was firſt in them: The Word (again) neceſſarily implies it. But as it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſecret deſire after ſin, and diſlike of, and repining againſt Gods Juſtice, threatning puniſhment againſt ſuch and ſuch ſins (wherein its ſlaviſhneſs doth conſiſt) ſo, it is utterly to be condemned.</p>
                  <p>Filial fear is, a reverential fear of Gods Majeſty and Power, <hi>Gen</hi> 28. 17. A trembling at his Judgments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 120. This fear hath a ſpecial regard unto the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as ſin by its guilt ſeparates from God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 2.

                  <p>Initial fear is a middle fear between theſe two: cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man to abſtain from ſin, &amp; to do good with a reſpect, partly to the puniſhment, and partly to the offence: However, it proceeds not from the firſt, but is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Reverential or Filial Fear: and ariſing from Love, upon effectual Calling, begun in the ſoul: and there ſhewing it ſelf, as the working of Faith (as yet) but in a weak meaſure. Which Fear, as Faith and Love gather ſtrength, is by degrees expelled, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>This way by fear, the Lord at the beginning took with <hi>Adam.</hi> Firſt, he had wrought in him an apprehenſion of fear of the Curſe, threatned againſt him upon his diſobedience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 10. And then after, followed the

                  <p>This way he ſtill continues. Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, then Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5. 45. Firſt, there muſt be an apprehenſion of Gods Juſtice, and then of his Mercy in his Son, ſweetned by the foregoing ſeverity of the ſharp Schoolmaſter of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account it is, that the Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel do [yet] preach the Law.

            <p>Let them not turn again to Folly.</p>
            <p>The Text conſiſts of three Clauſes; in every of which, each word hath its weight: I ſhall by way of Illuſtration, touch upon each of them; and after a brief Paraphraſe, for their further clearing, I ſhall propound the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
            <p>The firſt Clauſe is, I <hi>will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will hear what he will ſpeak to the diſtreſſed Soul, by his Word, by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>I will hear what he will ſpeak; for, I know it will be Comfort and Caution.</p>
            <p>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak: He ſees, knowes, and pities his people in their diſtreſſe, and is moſt ready and able to help them.</p>
            <p>I will hear God the Lord, and him only.</p>
            <p>I will hear him: I will attend diligently to his Will, that I may know it, obey it, acquaint others with it.</p>
            <p>I will hear him: My Reſolutions are fixed to hear him, againſt all gainſayers.</p>
            <p>(I) will hear him. My Greatneſs (though a King) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts me not from this duty: My holineſs (as a Saint, and his true Servant) binds me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>(I) will hear him. I will give good example unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; I will teach, exhort, encourage, pray for them: But, if notwithſtanding all this, they neglect their duty, yet, I will hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(For, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> In theſe two laſt Clauſes, are ſet down a twofold reaſon, why the Pſalmiſt in behalf of the Saints, is ſo reſolvedly ſet upon it to hear God the Lord, and him alone.</p>
            <p>The firſt being taken from that Comfort, which the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137309:109"/> Lord would afford unto the Soul, in ſpeaking Peace to it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, from that good, which might redound thereunto, by his Fatherly Caution and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He will ſpeak Peace unto his People, and to his Saints.</hi> Unto his People; not to the world, not to ſtubborn impenitent ſinners.</p>
            <p>And to his Saints; ſuch are all his People: and he owns none other for his, but thoſe who are truly ſuch.</p>
            <p>He will ſpeak Peace, Comfort, Settlement, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, Pardon, Acceptance.</p>
            <p>He will ſpeak Peace, by a full aſſurance thereof in the Soul.</p>
            <p>He will ſpeak Peace, when his People ſhall have turned from their ſins by true repentance, and Faith in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>He will ſpeak Peace, if not preſently upon their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and Faith, yet moſt certainly in his good time.</p>

            <p>Let them not turn again to Folly, to the Folly of ſin.</p>
            <p>Let them not turn again. Peace ſpoken to the ſoul, is worth the prizing, worth the preſerving. Relapſes are dangerous.</p>
            <p>Let them not turn again: If they do, the fault is not in God, he is moſt unwilling they ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urn again: Neither in Satan wholly; he can but tempt and perſwade, he cannot force them to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; it is chiefly in themſelves: <hi>Let them not turn,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:137309:109"/>
            <p> That yet I may give more light unto the words; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you heard the Pſalmiſt expreſſing himſelf, and his meaning ſomwhat more fully and plainly, to this or the like effect.</p>
            <p>While the Lords people go on in a conſtant courſe of Obedience unto his Will, they enjoy a ſweet peace in their ſouls; being aſſured, that the Lord doth accept of them, and their (though but weak) ſervices in his Son.</p>
            <p>But when they fall into the folly of ſin (eſpecially of hainous ſins, then their peace is interrupted, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances and unſettlements do ariſe in their ſouls, out of an apprehenſion of the Lords diſpleaſure againſt them for ſuch their Folly.</p>
            <p>Being in this ſad condition, if they deſire, that the breach ſhould be made up, their Souls again ſetled, &amp; their Peace reſtored, their only way is, to turn from their Follies by true repentance and faith in Chriſt; and then the Lord in his good time, will moſt certainly ſpeak peace unto them.</p>
            <p>Others (indeed) will be offering unto them Peace, and ſettlement, ſuch as it is: But let them take heed, how they liſten to any, but unto God the Lord. And when he hath ſpoken peace unto them, let them (for it will nearly concern them) be as wary of giving cauſe of a new broach, by turning again unto Folly.</p>
            <p>The words (thus cleared) do afford unto our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration theſe Three Doctrinal Concluſions:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That when the Lords people do fall into the folly of hainous ſins, they loſe their peace, and great diſturbances, perplexities, unſettlements do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ariſe in their ſouls.</p>
            <p>2. That when the Lords people do, by unf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>igned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Faith in Chriſt, turn from their folly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:137309:110"/> of ſin, the Lord in his good time, will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſpeak peace unto them.</p>
            <p>3. That when the Lord ſpeaks peace unto his People, they are to hear him, and him only; and peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken, that it concerns them to be very wary how they turn again to Folly.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Branch</hi> 1. 1. That all ſin is Folly.</p>
                  <p>There is a threefold Folly.</p>
                  <p>1. Negative Folly, which (indeed) is not ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Folly; being nothing elſe but the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or want of wiſdom, ſuch as is in Ideots or Naturals (as we call them) it is an uncapable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wiſdom: Of this, the word here is not meant.</p>
                  <p>The other two ſorts are properly called Folly; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the</p>
                  <p>1. Is Privative; when a man having a capable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wiſdom, yet wittingly and willingly doth neglect the means to attain it. The<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is that kind of folly, which is contrary to true wiſdom; erring from that Rule, by which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>der all her actions. And of theſe two, the word in the Text, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; of the wilful Folly, and of the erring or tranſgreſſing Folly.</p>
                  <p>That all ſin is Folly or Fooliſhneſs in one of theſe two fore-mentioned regards, is evident from the Text, where under that name, the Lords people are warned to beware of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Sin is ſo called, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 18. So, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 25. Where it is called the wickedneſs of Folly; &amp; in many other places.</p>
                  <p>I might give you Inſtances of many ſins, which in Scripture are branded with this Title; as,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> The Reaſon why ſin is branded with this Title of Folly, is, becauſe there is no ſin committed, but, ſome way or other, it fals ſhort of the Rule of right Reaſon (which is Gods Will expreſſed in his Word) by which Rule, every godly wiſe man, as near as he can, doth regulate and order all his actions.</p>
                  <p>He, who orders his Actions according to this Rule, he is a wiſe man; and ſo far as a man fals ſhort of this Rule, ſo far muſt his Actions neceſſarily be fooliſh and ſinful.</p>
                  <p>A mans Actions (though in themſelves good) yet may fall ſhort of this Rule. <hi>Short of Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By raſh unadviſedneſs. The Godly wiſe man takes counſel and advice within himſelf, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:137309:111"/> is willing to be directed by others, he cals to mind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things, and layes one thing to another, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them together, that ſo he may adviſedly proceed in what he is about to do: he ponders and weighes the path of his Feet, and ſo his wayes are eſtabliſhed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 26.</p>
                  <p>But the ſinful, fooliſh man is carried on headlong with a precipitate raſhneſs, and ſo his wayes are as darkneſs, and he knowes not at what he ſtumbles, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 19. Stumble he doth, and cannot but ſtumble, and fall into the folly of ſin, becauſe he walks in darkneſs, and is raſhly and unadviſedly carried on by his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe will or Paſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A mans wayes may fall ſhort of the Rule of right Reaſon by an indiſcreet inconſiderateneſs.</p>
                  <p>The godly wiſe man, his eyes look right on, and his eye-lids look ſtraight before him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 25. He ſhuns as near as he can, all manner of evil with much warineſs. He is very circumſpect in obſerving of all due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, for the manner, time, place of performance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He walks circumſpectly, not as a Fool, but as a wiſe man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
                  <p>But the fooliſh ſinner conſiders not his Actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be good or evil: He minds not any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlance in their performance, but goes on in a careleſs manner, and ſo his actions become fooliſh and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Amans actions may fall ſhort of this Rule by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy.</p>
                  <p>The godly wiſe man (as he proceeds on with good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and due conſideration, ſo) he is firm in his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and acts accordingly. He doth righteouſneſs at all times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 3. He is ſtedfaſt and unmoveable in the work of the Lord, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15. 58.</p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:137309:111"/>
                  <p> But the fooliſh ſinner he recedes, and fals off from that good which formerly he had pitched upon; and by his Corruption or Paſſion is carried away to ſomthing which he conceives may be more profitable or delightful unto him. He is a double-minded man, unſtable in his wayes, <hi>James</hi> 1. 8. And this his Inconſtancy and unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſs, makes his actions become fooliſh and ſinful.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A mans actions may fall ſhort of this Rule by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
                  <p>The godly wiſe man is a man of foreſight, he foreſees the evil and hideth himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 12.

                  <p>The Pſalmiſt gives us here in the Text an infallible Character of them; they are the Saints, his people, and his Saints.</p>
                  <p>The word [Saint] ſignifies holy. There is an holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by Faith, and an holineſs by Obedience.</p>
                  <p>By Faith, Saints, and faithful Brethren, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>By Obedience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 5. Gather my Saints together, that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:137309:115"/> by the Sacrifice of themſelves and their Wills, to me in their obedience, which is better then all Sacrifices, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 10. That give up themſelves (ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) as a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, in their reaſonable Service of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two muſt go together: and (indeed) they cannot well be parted; the one being as the eye of the Soul, the other as the hand. In vain doth the eye di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, where there is not an hand to work: and as vain is it for the hand to ſet it ſelf to work, without an eye to direct. Obedience without Faith, is blind, and Faith without Obedience is dead; but joyn them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that man that is thus holy, truly faithful, and truly obedient, he is the true Saint; and the Lord owns ſuch, and only ſuch for his people.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. For a man then to be baptized, and to make an outward Profeſſion of the Faith of Chriſt, this is not enough to make him a true Saint.</p>
                  <p>It is true, St. <hi>Paul</hi> by his own example, in <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 2. hath taught us to judge of all, that are baptized, and do make an outward Profeſſion of the Faith, to judge, and hope of them according to the Rule of Charity; and (unleſs their notorious wicked lives do manifeſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) to eſteem them to be Saints. Notwithſtanding without all queſtion, many thou ands are baptized, and are Chriſtians by Profeſſion, who are far from being Saints, and ever ſhall be.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it enough to make a true Saint, for a man by vow, to dedicate and give up himſelf to the Service of God, as all do in their Baptiſm. For are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſacrilegious wretches, who though they have ſo done, yet rob God of what by vow they have given unto him; treacherouſly deſerting of him, and giving themſelves up to the ſervice of the Devil, the World, and their own corrupt Fleſh?</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:137309:115"/>
                  <p> Neither doth a man preſently become a Saint, aſſoon as he is admitted a Member of a Gathered Church. As to their ſincerity, they may ſtill be Hypocrites: and as to holineſs of life, the practiſes of ſome of them, after their immembring, have been ſo abominable (as I have been certainly informed, by thoſe, whom I dare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) that that Proverb may well be taken up againſt them, There are but few Saints in the Church, when the Devil carries the Holy Water.</p>
                  <p>Much leſs is it enough to make a true Saint, to be Canonized at <hi>Rome,</hi> and have a day aſſigned in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar. Doubtleſs there are many in their Regiſter, whom the Lord will never number amongſt his Saints. No, it is only true Faith, and true Obedience that makes a true Saint.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Are the Saints the Lords people? Here let us take notice of that high dignity, and thoſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry priviledges, to which the Saints are advanced and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: They are the Lords people; he owns them as his peculiar treaſure, and by ſuch his owning, they are intereſſed in all the Bleſſings, all the Promiſes contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word, temporal, ſpiritual, eternal.</p>
                  <p>Their Priviledges are ſo many they cannot be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; ſo precious, they cannot be ſufficiently valued.

                  <p>For thus they may argue, upon Infallible Grounds:</p>
                  <p>If I am a Saint (whereof by my true Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience I am aſſured) then am I effectually called. For, I am what I was called to be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 7.</p>

                  <p>If I am elected, then I am predeſtinated to Glory, and ſhall moſt certainly enjoy it: For, he that elected me, predeſtinated me, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. And whom he predeſtinated,

However, theſe ſweet Comforts of theirs, cannot but be much allayed, by their ſenſe of their weakneſs and frailty.

                  <p>In the fear of his Wrath.</p>
                  <p>We have both of them before the Text.</p>

                  <p>There they deprecate wrath, and ſue to have it removed; from the ſeizure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they knew, that, without Mercy, they could not be ſaved: But it would burn againſt them, and be drawn out, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue upon them.</p>
                  <p>1. Then, the Lords people and Saints, when fallen into the Folly of hainous ſins, they loſe their Peace, and are diſturbed and unſetled in their Souls, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded with the Apprehenſion of loſſe.</p>
                  <p>Of the loſſe of God, Chriſt, the Spirit.</p>

                  <p>Their Faith in Chriſt is ſeemingly dead,

                  <p>They cannot find any effectual workings, no not ſo much as (thoſe diſcoveries of life) the leaſt ſtirrings of the Spirit in their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>They cannot pray with Confidence. They cannot (as formerly) rely upon, and ſhrowd themſelves under Gods wing for Protection: their hedge of defence is broken down, and the Tents of thoſe heavenly Guardians, the Angels, formerly pitched about them for their ſafety, are overthrown.</p>
                  <p>So that in this regard, they are in a worſe-eſtate, (for the time) then when firſt freed from the power of Darkneſs. Then they were wounded and pricked at their hearts, and had fearful apprehenſions of wrath: But, now, beſide that, they feel the ſmart of this wound of loſſe.</p>
                  <p>And this is all the good we get by ſin, it robs us of our God, it makes a ſeparation between him and us, and cauſeth him to hide his Face from us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 2.</p>

                  <p>And the loſs is yet the greater, and the wound the deeper and more ſmarting, according to the Saints love towards God. It goes to the heart of a man to loſe what he loves.

                  <p>And the Saints know, that the Lord is juſt; that, though he delights not in the deſtruction or puniſhment of his Creature, yet he delights in his Juſtice, according to which, puniſhment is executed upon ſinners.</p>
                  <p>They know that God, who is the God of Order, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers nothing to be out of order; and therefore, that he will bring their ſins (which in themſelves are nothing but A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p> Thus, in the former wound of loſſe, God hides his face from them; and now in this, they are as ready to flee from, and hide themſelves from him.</p>
                  <p>For, though the eternal and ſecret bond of his Love of good will, depending upon their Election, cannot be broken: Yet, that of Friendſhip which depends upon Faith and Holineſs (as to ſenſe and exerciſe) is for the time diſſolved: So that while th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. When therefore you ſee any of the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this diſtreſſed condition, labouring and languiſhing under the burden of their ſins, paſſe not your cenſures upon them raſhly, as if they were diſtempered and beſide themſelves; but know,</p>
                  <p>That they are under Gods ſore preſſing hand; that he hath wounded them for the health of their Souls; that he hath caſt them into the hot Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of his fiery indignation: that, being purged and purified from the droſſe, they may come forth like refined Gold, fit to make Veſſels of honour for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Here let us be taught to walk warily, to work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling, to ſerve our God with fear and trembling, to ſerve our God with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and godly fear; knowing that he is a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, and that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Doth the Lord deal thus ſeverely with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Saints, when fallen into the folly of heinous ſins, to raiſe ſuch tempeſts in their ſouls? Yet let them not when brought low under his heavy hand, deſpair of Mercy.</p>
                  <p>The Lord is pleaſed ſomtimes to bring his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple even to the brink of deſpair, as I could inſtance in a Gentlewoman (I ſuppoſe) the Grand-mother to a Family of good note, and worth in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> I had the Relation from a true ſervant of God, who at that time (or not long after) lived in the Family. And therefore I do confidently believe it, and ſo ſet it down for a known truth.</p>
                  <p>This Gentlewoman, labouring under the burden of her ſins, had ſo far caſt away all hope of Mercy, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:137309:124"/> a pure Venice-Glaſs in her hand, in the extremity of her Agony, ſhe threw it with violence againſt the ground, ſaying, ſhe was as ſure ſhe ſhould be damned, as ſhe was, that that Glaſs would break.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord was pleaſed at that inſtant, to raiſe her to an hope of pardon upon her repentance, and ſo to an hope of ſalvation by a ſtrange means: For, the Glaſs (though ſo pure, and caſt with ſuch violence) did not break, but was taken up whole.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever then may be, or are in this ſad condition, let them by all means take heed of offering ſo high an indignity and affront unto God, as to deſpair of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; as if his mercy, which is above all his works, were overcome by our ſins; or his hand ſo ſhortned, that he could not ſave; or the Fountain of Chriſt's Bloud, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſin and for uncleanneſs, were dried up.</p>
                  <p>Our ſins may be greater then we can bear; but they cannot be greater, or more then he can forgive.</p>
                  <p>Neither let any defer the Cure of their wounds, until they do ſtink, and corrupt through ſuch their Fooliſhneſs of delaying; but let them haſten with ſpeed unto the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoveraign remedy for their recovery.</p>
                  <p>Let them bath and ſupple them with the tears of true repentance: Let them apply unto them the Balm of Chriſt's Merits; and they will find (in Gods time) health and ſettlement in their Souls; their broken bones ſhall rejoyce; and the Lord will again cauſe the light of his countenance to ſhine upon them, and will ſpeak peace unto them: Which is the;</p>

                     <p>They muſt confeſs them.</p>
                     <p>They muſt be ſorry for them. <note place="margin">Four Acts of Repent.</note>

                     <p>They muſt hate them.</p>
                     <p>They muſt reſolve againſt them, and all other; and upon better obedience for the time to come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Act</hi> 1. Wouldſt thou have Peace ſpoken to thy ſoul, confeſſe thy ſins unto God. If we confeſſe, God is Faithful and juſt to forgive, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. If we confeſs and forſake, we ſhall have Mercy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13.</p>
                     <p>Crude, indigeſted matter in the ſtomack cauſeth much gnawing and trouble there; but aſſoon as it is caſt up, the ſtomack is at eaſe. The Compariſon is but homely; but it is the Spirits own Dialect, good enough for ſin, which cannot be made too loathſom: But with it then, vomit it up by Confeſſion, and thy ſoul will be ſetled, and at eaſe.</p>
                     <p>But what need we confeſs our ſins to God, doth not he already know them?</p>
                     <p>Yes, he doth, but he would have thee to know them, he would have thee ſenſible of their hainouſneſs, and of that Corruption of thine heart, which ſecretly conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with thine Arch Enemy, hath inſenſibly led thee to thoſe Follies, whereby thou haſt loſt thy God, and provoked his wrath againſt thee.</p>

This is the true breaking of heart, which muſt not only be attrite or broken into great pieces in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of ſome notorious, ſcandalous ſins; but it muſt be contrite, broken and pounded to powder, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all our known Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>4. In true Confeſſion, there will be an aggravating of ſin, a ſtriving to ſet it forth in its own loathſomneſs, and deformity I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and againſt thee, ſaid the Prodigal, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:137309:126"/> ſhewed our ſelves weary of that Government the Lord had appointed over us: We have moſt unthankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his Prophet, who hath carried himſelf ſo upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that none of us can charge him with the leaſt act of Injuſtice, and ſo we have rejected God himſelf. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> aggravates his ſins, calling himſelf the chief of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. That he, that had been ſo bred, and knew ſo much, that he ſhould be ſuch a cruel Perſecuter, and Blaſphemer.</p>
                     <p>O, I have ſinned againſt knowledge, Mercies, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Chaſtiſements, Vows, Promiſes, Means, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Checks; after this manner doth the ſoul aggravate its ſinful Follies in its Confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>5. In true Confeſſion there will be ſhame: A Saint will bluſh in ſecret, to think that his ſoul, which Chriſt hath married to himſelf in righteouſneſs, ſhould be ſo polluted and defiled.</p>
                     <p>What fruit had you then in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21.</p>
                     <p>Sin is alwaies attended with ſhame, either with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful ſhame from others, or a penitent ſhame in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, or a confounding ſhame in the end.</p>
                     <p>Some indeed are ſo hardned, that (as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 3.) They have Whores Forheads, and refuſe to be aſhamed: But, the truly penitent ſoul, in its Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, acknowledgeth with <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 9. 7.

                     <p>6. Laſtly, In true Confeſſion, there will be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of our unworthineſs. <hi>Jacobs</hi> Language is, I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy Mercies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10.

The ſoul caſts it ſelf low at the Foot-ſtool of God, with humble thoughts of it ſelf.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Act</hi> 2. The ſecond Act of true Repentance is, ſorrow for ſin. This (with the next, of hatred of ſin) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the word (rending) which the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> uſeth, alluding therein to the practiſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who did uſe to rend their Garments, upon the ſight or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any ſad or loathſom thing; as <hi>Jacob</hi> did for the loſs of his Son <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 37. 34. and the High Prieſt, at the (ſuppoſed) Blaſphemy of Chriſt, when he ſaid, he was the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 65.</p>

                     <p>O, the Saint of the Lord grieves, and mourns in his ſoul, that by his Follies he hath offended his good God, his loving Father, ſo gentle, ſo merciful, ſo gracious, ſo patient, ſo ſlow to anger, ſo ready to pardon: This goes near him, this doth exceedingly afflict him. Though it may be, the temper of his Body is ſuch, that not a Tear fals from his eye; yet he would willingly if he could, that his heart ſhould weep tears of Bloud, for thoſe his ſinful Follies, whereby he hath provoked ſuch a God, ſuch a tender and loving Father.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Then, True ſorrow for ſin makes a man careful to ſhun all ſin for the time to come; eſpecially that, or thoſe late Follies, wherewith he was overtaken.

                     <p>The ſorrowful Soul will not only be ſhy of known ſins, which he knows to be ſuch; but he will abſtain from all appearance of evil, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. The Second Effect is Indignation, which (in it ſelf) is a grief at the proſperity of thoſe, whom we think unworthy of it.</p>
                     <p>In reference to ſin, it is a mixture of grief and anger, againſt a mans own Corruption; that it ſhould ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over him, and enſlave him; that he ſhould be compaſſed about with ſuch a body of death, from which he knows not which way to be delivered.</p>
                     <p>Such a mixture of Paſſion, was doubtleſs in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſtirring againſt his croſs Fleſh or Corruption, that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt the Law of his mind, and was ſtill at his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and preſent with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He knows his carnal part is as treacherous as ever, and the Devil as malicious againſt him as ever, and his Aſſaults as violent; and he knows not how ſoon the Lord may leave him to himſelf; and then in what caſe he ſhall be, his late experience of diſturbances, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, troubles, wounds, loſſe, wrath, can tell him a ſad ſtory.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He that is truly ſorry for ſin, his deſire is vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and earneſt, that he may pleaſe God for the time to come. What would he not now do to win his Favour? His own corrupt will hath formerly miſled him, to the provoking of his God; but now he ſubmits it unto Gods Will in all things. Let him command what he will, he is ready to obey it: Let him reſtrain him in any thing, he declines it. Let him lay upon him what he pleaſeth, he patiently undergoes it. Let him defer to anſwer his Prayers, he waits Gods time. In a word, the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and earneſt deſire of his ſoul is, that he may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, by a dayly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving in the knowledge of him, and by a further fruitfulneſs in every good work.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He that is truly ſorry for ſin, he becomes zealous againſt ſin, as that which is ſo offenſive unto his God. Thus <hi>David's</hi> zealous ſorrow appeared in his Tears: For, his eyes ran down with Rivers of water, becauſe men kept not Gods Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. 136. <hi>Lot</hi>'s righteous ſoul was vexed with the filthy Converſation of the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. He is often thinking and talking of that which is good, and rejoyceth to ſee others do that which is good. He remembers whence he is fallen, to what a fair degree in Grace he had formerly attained; and now he ſtrains himſelf to the utmoſt to recover it, and to go beyond it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. He takes revenge upon himſelf for his former fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, by watching, faſting, praying, by denying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in thoſe Contents, which otherwiſe without offence he might freely enjoy.</p>
                     <p>This Effect of Revenge ſome Commentators would find in the broken heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 17.

                     <p>Whether the word will bear ſuch a meaning or not, I contend not. It is enough we have St. <hi>Pauls</hi> example for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. We may, nay ought to keep under our bodies, and bring them into ſubjection, that ſo they may be the fitter to joyn with our ſouls in Gods Service: though, by ſo doing, we cannot ſatisfie for the leaſt of our ſinful follies.</p>

                     <p>That ſin is moſt loathſom and hateful, is evident from thoſe Compariſons, by which its Loathſomneſs is ſet forth in Scripture. It is compared to the Leproſie, to menſtruous rags, to pollutions of the Birth, to vomit, to mire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe it is ſo loathſom and abominable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Lord hate and abhor it, as is to be ſeen, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. and in many other places.</p>

                     <p> The Lord is in his Eſſence and Nature, moſt pure; and therefore doth he naturally and eſſentially hate all filthineſs and impurity.

                  <p>What ſhall the Saints enjoy more in Heaven it ſelf (as to their ſouls) but this begun happineſs in a full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment? When, for Faith, they ſhall ſee face to face; and for hope, ſhall fully and ſatisfiedly enjoy: and for imperfect Love, ſhall perfectly, and for ever love this great Feaſt-maker and Feaſt-continuer in the ſoul, even the God of Peace, and Prince of Peace, and Spirit of Peace; who thus upon their unfaigned Humiliation and Faith, doth and will fill the ſouls of his People and Saints with Peace. And that moſt certainly, there is not the leaſt queſtion or doubt to be moved, but that he will do it: Which is,</p>
                  <p>The next Particular to be ſpoken to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Partic.</hi> 2. That the Lord (in his good time) will moſt certainly ſpeak peace unto the Soul. He will ſpeak peace unto his people and Saints.</p>
                  <p>This Certainty I ground upon a threefold Reaſon, that the Lord will, nay cannot but ſpeak peace unto the truly penitent and faithful ſoul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe by its humiliation, its now become a ſpiritual <hi>vacuum</hi> or emptineſs, and ſo is fitly prepared, and put into a capacity for the entertainment of Gods Favour in ſpeaking peace unto it.</p>
                  <p>That which is full cannot receive another body; but,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:137309:139"/> that which is voyd and empty may. Now as it is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, Nature cannot endure a vacuity or empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but to avoyd ſuch an Inconvenience, doth ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily force bodies againſt their nature to fill it up.</p>
                  <p>So the Lord ſuffers not a ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ritual emptineſs in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart; but ſends a River of heavenly peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to fill it.</p>
                  <p>This Reaſon I confeſs, is not ſo forcing: But, in reſpect of the other two, which follow (let me ſpeak with all due reverence of his dreadful Majeſty) a kind of neceſſity lies upon God, to ſpeak peace to the truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and faithful ſoul.</p>
                  <p>2. Therefore, God cannot but ſpeak peace unto it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath given it ſuch a prevayling power over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I cannot do any thing till thou art come to <hi>Zoar.</hi> It is the Lords ſpeech to <hi>Lot,</hi> when about to deſtroy <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and the reſt of the Cities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 22. to <hi>Moſes</hi> likewiſe, Let me alone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32 10. So to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Let me go, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 4. As if theſe Saints of his had ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered God, and held his hands, that he could not do what otherwiſe he would.</p>
                  <p>So the humbled and faithful ſoul may, in reference to that power, which the Lord hath given it over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to which he is pleaſed to ſubmit his own Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſs (being conſcious to it ſelf, of its unfaigned humiliation and faith in the Promiſes of the Goſpel) it may with an holy boldneſs ſay unto God. I will not let thee alone, I will not let thee go, until thou ſpeak peace unto my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of this power it was, that <hi>David</hi> entitled the 51 Pſalm (wherein is ſet forth his Repentance and Faith) <hi>Vincenti,</hi> or <hi>provictoria,</hi> To the Conqueror, or for the Victory: Becauſe he was aſſured, that the Lord would not deſpiſe: Deſpiſe!

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:137309:140"/> offered up upon the Altar Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. The Lord cannot but ſpeak peace unto the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and faithful ſoul, becauſe he is Faithful and Juſt.</p>
                  <p>Confeſſion of ſin is an act of true Repentance; and S. <hi>John</hi> cells us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. that if we confeſs our ſins, joyning with our Confeſſion, the other acts of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) God is faithful and juſt, to forgive them.</p>
                  <p>He is faithful: He hath promiſed Pardon and peace to the humbled and faithful ſoul; pardon, as there in St. <hi>John;</hi> peace, as here in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, he is juſt to forgive: And indeed, the ſoul being in ſuch a temper, truly broken and humbled for ſin, and cloſely applying unto it ſelf the Promiſes of Grace, Pardon and Peace, made unto it in Chriſt: being thus diſpoſed, it would be great Injuſtice to deny it Peace.</p>

He will not, he cannot be ſo unjuſt. And therefore, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:137309:140"/> to Chriſt's Merits and ſatisfaction, and for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his own Juſtice, he cannot but ſpeak peace to the truly humbled and faithful ſoul.</p>

When he finds, that he cannot prevail that way, but that the Lord doth ſtill uphold the Soul, though under a weighty burden, he ſets on the World (which he hath at his Command) to offer them Peace, and that very freely, and liberally to give it unto them, without any conditions, proviſo's, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; and he ſecretly ſuggeſts unto the carnal part that peace and ſettlement is there to be had, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them to accept of it.</p>

                  <p>And the Saints (though in this ſad condition, yet) are his people, whom he loves, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. Towards whom he is tender-hearted, very pitiful, and of tender Mercy, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 11. He pitieth thoſe that fear him, as a Father pitieth his Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 13. And therefore (as he is able and skilful, ſo) he is moſt ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to help them, to ſettle them, &amp; to cure their wounds.</p>
                  <p>The World is a Phyſition of no value, a meer Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, a bold Mountebank, that neither is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any Soveraign Remedy, nor knows how to apply it, being altogether ignorant of the ſtate of the ſoul in its diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>Beſide, the Lords people and Saints are moſt hateful unto it, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15. 19. And ſhall they believe, that their deadly enemy (if it were able, and had skill) would be willing to ſettle and recover them?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Reaſon why, in ſpeaking peace, the Lord alone is to be heard, is taken from that aſſurance, which the Lord rayſeth in the ſoul, that he is at peace with it. For he ſpeaks peace to it. He makes the ſoul as ſtrongly perſwaded of peace, and as confidently to build upon it, as if it heard the Lord himſelf ſpeak it immediatly from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The Grounds whereon this aſſurance is built in the ſoul are,</p>
                  <p>His Decree, which is ſtable &amp; unchangeable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                  <p>His Promiſe, which is Yea and Amen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20.</p>

                  <p>His Hand for it in his written Word, which he will not deny, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4.</p>
                  <p>His Seal to it, his Spirit, which he cannot but own, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
                  <p>His Delivery of this Aſſurance, which he will not revoke, <hi>John</hi> 14. 27.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:137309:145"/>

                  <p>Thus the Lord ſpeaks peace unto the Soul, by thus aſſuring of it, that he is no more an enemy or a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger unto it; which muſt needs ſettle it, and fill it with ſtrong Conſolation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18</p>
                  <p>When the World can afford to the unſetled and wounded Spirit ſuch grounds of aſſurance of Peace and Settlement, it may then hope the Lords people may be perſwaded to hearken unto it; till then, it may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear its frank, but empty Tenders.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which I intend to ſpeak of, is, becauſe by their turning again unto Folly, after Peace ſpoken, they draw a greater guilt upon their ſouls, and ſo, do more provoke the Lords wrath againſt them; and thereupon cannot but juſtly fear and expect to be corrected with a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:137309:148"/> more ſtinging rod, with a ſharper and more ſmarting puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Now the guilt of the ſoul, turning again unto the Folly of ſin, after peace ſpoken unto it, is heightened and enlarged exceedingly, by the concurrence of many grievous ſins, committed in ſuch backſliding: For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aggrav.</hi> Here is a falling back from thoſe reſolutions in Repentance, wherein the ſoul in its diſtreſs, did bind it ſelf by promiſe and vow unto God; that it would, for the time to come, abhor and decline the wayes of ſinful Folly, and walk before him in better Obedience.</p>
                  <p>If it did but barely reſolve ſo, yet not to keep up ſuch reſolutions, and ſo to cheriſh them, that they may be derived into act, this failing, and falling from them, diſcovers a want of due care and diligence; the neglect whereof, after peace ſpoken, renders the ſoul more guilty.</p>
                  <p>But, if to ſuch reſolutions, there were added a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Vow, ſo to walk before God, which it was but meet the Soul ſhould do; ſurely it is meet to be ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, I have born Chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more.

                  <p>What is it, but to mock God? What, but to take his Name in vain? And ſo to do, is it not a new, and high provoking Folly? Will the Lord hold ſuch an one guiltleſs? Pay that thou haſt vowed. God hath no pleaſure in Fools, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5, 4.</p>

                  <p>It was an high aggravation of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin, that they forgat God their Saviour &amp; Deliverer, <hi>Pſ</hi> 106 21.
